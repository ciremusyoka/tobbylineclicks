    							<p>
Art is about the moments. Photography freezes the moment for me. Anytime I look through
the lenses and lock on my subject everything else becomes absolute. I walk through with
Clicks until I have captured the magic light.
Being an Engineer class taught me how to fix and build things but photography has told me
the magic of trapping light and creating beauty.
Book me for any outdoor event, corporate shots and the result will be breath taking.
